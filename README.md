# Online Travel Reservation

> Team project for Graduate software engineering course Enterprise Distributed Systems.

## Goal

* The goal is to build a distributed enterprise web application which enables the user not only to search for Cars, Hotels and Flights and make a booking but also login/signup along with editing user preferences and viewing travel history. As well as create a Admin side which can be used to add/edit/delete Flights, Cars and Hotels and also be able to delete the user and view the analytics/statistics.

* We were tasked with this project requirement so that we can learn and develop enterprise MERN stack applications with the use of distributed publish-subscribe messaging system like Apache Kafka along with a variety of other technologies like Elasticsearch, redis, mocha, etc.
